# Admissions Data analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Admissions Data" using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of variables related to student admissions, including marks, admission status, and gender. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

The "Admissions Data" dataset contains information about student admissions. Each entry represents a student's application and includes the following columns:

- **Marks**: Marks obtained by the student in the admission examination.
- **Admitted**: Admission status of the student (Admitted or Not Admitted).
- **Gender**: Gender of the student (Male or Female).
